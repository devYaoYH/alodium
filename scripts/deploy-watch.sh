#!/usr/bin/env bash
# deploy-watch.sh — closes the merge→deploy gap: one idempotent pass of "did a
# PR merge on Forgejo? then run the normal deploy." launchd (or cron) provides
# the loop; this script provides the judgement.
#
#   ./scripts/deploy-watch.sh            # one pass (launchd provides the loop)
#   ./scripts/deploy-watch.sh --dry-run  # report what it would do; change nothing
#
# The operator's merge REMAINS the authorization moment (docs/AGENT.md); this
# only removes the manual `./scripts/deploy.sh` keystroke that used to follow
# it. No new trust surface: same host user, same deploy.sh, and it POLLS
# Forgejo rather than accepting inbound triggers — no webhook listener, and no
# Actions runner on node-config (agents push workflow files there in PR
# branches; a runner would execute them).
#
# What keeps it safe to loop:
#   - Deploys ONLY from a clean checkout parked on main. On a branch or with
#     tracked edits = the operator is mid-work; skip silently, the next
#     heartbeat catches up after they finish.
#   - deploy.sh's fast-forward-only merge still applies; a divergence deploys
#     nothing and files a `blocked` coordination issue instead.
#   - A failed deploy files ONE `blocked` issue per remote HEAD (stamp-deduped,
#     like the dispatcher's cooldown) so a broken deploy lands in the
#     operator's notebook once — not every two minutes.
